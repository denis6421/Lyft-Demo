                <p>Lyft Insurance Protection</p>
                <p>Lyft provides additional insurance policies, at no cost to the driver. We worked with leading insurance carriers to provide various coverages including: commercial auto liability insurance up to $1M per occurrence, contingent collision insurance
                  for drivers who carry collision coverage on their personal auto policy, and coverage for bodily injury caused by uninsured/underinsured motorists when you are engaged in a ride. If you already carry commercial insurance or personal coverage
                  providing specific coverage for ridesharing, Lyft’s policy will continue to be excess to your insurance coverage. Please note, the above coverage may be modified to comply with local regulations or state laws. Lyft’s policy is available in all
                  states in the U.S., except for those rides originating in New York or occurring at any time in a New York-registered vehicle in markets outside New York, such as New Jersey and Connecticut.

            <p>Passenger Ratings</p>
            <p>Drivers rate passengers after each ride, so you’ve always got a say. We also require passengers to provide valid credit card information for identity verification purposes.</p>

          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <h3>I already have a job, so can I just drive a few hours in my off-time?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. You choose when you drive. Some drivers make more than $800 just driving Friday nights and weekends.</p>

          <h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
          <p>Drivers get paid for every trip on a per minute and mile basis. Money is deposited into your account each week automatically, or you can cash out instantly with Express Pay.</p>

          <h3>Is Lyft safe?</h3>
          <p>Our community’s safety is our top priority. We run extensive background checks on drivers, provide up to $1M commercial automobile liability policy, and designed numerous safety features into our app. Passengers must provide a valid credit card and phone number for identity verification purposes. Drivers and passengers also rate each other at the end of a ride, so that we’re always upholding our high community standards.</p>

          <h3>What are Lyft’s requirements?</h3>
          <p>You must be at least 21 and own an iPhone or Android phone. As part of our approval process, you’ll undergo a DMV check, plus a national and county background check. This will require a Social Security number, in addition to an in-state driver’s license that is at least a year old. Learn more about our background check standards on our Safety page, and our comprehensive driver requirements in the Help Center.</p>
          <p>Your car needs to have four external door handles and at least five total seat belts. You must be a covered party on your car’s in-state insurance, and have in-state license plates. We’ll confirm all of this during your 19-point vehicle inspection. Cars have Lyft age requirements too, which can vary by state. See your state-specific requirements.</p>
